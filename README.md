bootstrap grid system, utilities, and components

I had no issues with Bootstrap specifically, but I did reorder the images in HTML file before styling. The issues I had with the cursor were resolved when I re-downloaded Visual Studio Code. 

I used the Bootstrap links provided and re-watched some of the module materials. There was a period when I was working on both assignments and might have have verified some code on W3Schools, but I think that was used mostly for Assignment #1.
